Tulip 

 - shy little flower 

 Grew up in a pot inside the house before she was recently replanted outside. She has been suffering from a lack of sunlight, and is on her last legs. The farmer received Tulip after his wife had died, and ahs been clinging onto her ever since. Tulip being mad at you could be cause by the farmer admitting he kept her inside for so long even though he knew a flower like that had to be outside. 




Introductory:   Oh... uh, hello there...   have we... met before? 

 

There’s all these roses around me, but none of them are true gentlemen! I need a man who knows how to treat a woman. But nooo, all they want is my flowery pistal. 

 

 

 

 

 

Sunflower 

 - grew up in a sunflower field, which is a very harsh environment – everyone competing for the same resources, trying to grow as tall as possible to steal as much sunlight as possible – until they moved into the farmer’s garden.  

 - Farmer owned the sunflower field, but also replanted the sunflower to their garden 

 

 

 

Nightshade 

 - twins, they are the reason the farmer’s wife is dead. Maybe they could be growing in a field of blueberries?
